//! @defgroup group_async_streams Async Streams
//! Read, transform and write data concurrently from async sources to destinations.
//!
/// Read, writes and transforms happen in parallel if sources and destinations are asynchronous.
/// This library does not allocate any memory, all buffers are supplied by the caller.
///
/// Async Streams are largely inspired by [node.js Streams](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html), a very powerful tool to
/// process large amounts of data concurrently.
///
/// The basic idea about an async stream is to create a Source / Sink abstraction (also called Readable and Writable)
/// and process small buffers of data at time.
///
/// The state machine that coordinates this interaction handles data buffering and more importantly handles also
/// back-pressure, that means:
///
/// - **Pausing** the readable stream when a connected writable stream cannot process data fast enough
/// - **Resuming** the readable stream when a connected writable stream is finally able to receive more data
///
/// By implementing streams on top of async operations it's possible to run many of them concurrently very efficiently.
/// When properly implemented for example an async pipeline can concurrently read from disk, write to a socket while
/// compressing data.
///
///
/// Most notable differences with node.js streams are for now:
///
/// - No allocation (designed to work inside user-provided list of buffers)
/// - No object mode
/// - Fixed Layout to create data pipelines (AsyncPipeline)
/// - onData support only (no readable event)
