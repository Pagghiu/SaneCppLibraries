# Status
ðŸŸ¨ MVP  
All classes defined in the library should be reasonably stable and safe to use.  

# Description

Generic data structures are a fundamental building blocks for almost every application.  
These are some of commonly used ones for common tasks, and the library will grow adding what's needed.

SC::Vector is the king of all generic containers for this library, being in many case the main backend storage for other containers.

SC::Array mimics all methods of SC::Vector but it's guaranteed never to allocate on heap.  
All methods are designed to fail with a `[[nodiscard]]` return value when the container is full.

SC::SmallVector is the middle ground between SC::Array and SC::Vector.  
It's a vector with inline storage for `N` elements, deriving from SC::Vector and it's designed to be passed everywhere a reference to SC::Vector is needed. This allows the caller to get rid of temporary heap allocations if an estimate of the space required is already known or if it's possible providing a reasonable default.  
If this estimation is wrong, heap allocation will happen.

# Details
- SC::Segment is the class representing a variable and contiguous slice of bytes or objects backing both SC::Vector, SC::SmallVector, SC::Array, SC::Buffer and SC::SmallBuffer.  
- Memory layout of a segment is a SC::SegmentHeader holding size and capacity of the segment followed by the actual elements. 
- SC::SegmentHeader is aligned to `uint64_t`.

# Roadmap

ðŸŸ© Usable Features:
- Add option to let user disable heap allocations in SC::SmallVector
- Explicit control on Segment / Vector allocators
- `HashMap<T>`
- `Map<K, V>`

ðŸŸ¦ Complete Features:
- More specific data structures

ðŸ’¡ Unplanned Features:
- None
