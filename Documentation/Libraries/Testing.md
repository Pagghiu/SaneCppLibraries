# Status

ðŸŸ¨ MVP  
Testing library is minimal but it's useful as is for now.

# Description
Testing integrates with the SC::Result object that is part of [Foundation](@ref library_foundation) library.
So far it doesn't support test discovery and all tests must be manually invoked in the main test file.

## SC::TestCase
@copydoc SC::TestCase

## SC::TestReport
@copydoc SC::TestReport

# Roadmap

ðŸŸ© Usable
- Test discovery

ðŸŸ¦ Complete Features:
- IDE Integration

ðŸ’¡ Unplanned Features:
- Template tests
