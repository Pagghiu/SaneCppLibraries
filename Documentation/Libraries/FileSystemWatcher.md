# Details

The class tries to unify differences between OS specific API to deliver folder change notifications

- On macOS and iOS `FSEvents` by `CoreServices` is used.  
- On Windows `ReadDirectoryChangesW` is used.  

The behavior between these different system also depends on the file system where the watched directory resides.

@note On iOS `FSEvents` api is private so using SC::FileSystemWatcher will be very likely causing your app to be rejected from the app store.

# Examples

- [SCExample](@ref page_examples) uses SC::FileSystemWatcher for a simple hot-reload system
- Unit test inside `FileSystemWatcherTest.cpp` show how the API is meant to be used

# Roadmap

ðŸŸ¦ Complete Features:
- Not sure what else could be useful here

ðŸ’¡ Unplanned Features:
- Having a thread based polling stat watcher that checks file modifications on intervals as fallback
- Allow users to provide their own thread instead of creating it behind the scenes
