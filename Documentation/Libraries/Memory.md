[TOC]

Memory library helps tracking and limiting runtime / dynamic allocations through the use of custom allocators.

If a library doesn't directly or indirectly depend on the Memory library, you can assume that it will not do any runtime / dynamic allocation.

Most classes have been originally part of the [Foundation](@ref library_foundation) library.

# Status
ðŸŸ© Usable  
The library is solid. The Buffer implementation has been evolved and fine tuned to be minimal but effective.

# Description
Memory library helps tracking and limit runtime / dynamic allocations through the use of custom allocators.
A classic dynamically expandable binary buffer SC::Buffer is provided and it's largely shared to form the more _object model oriented_ SC::Vector class from [Containers](@ref library_containers) Library.

All allocations throughout all downstream dependant libraries are centrally tracked by the SC::Globals class, that also allows re-defining custom thread-local allocators.

Such allocators can be just fixed buffers, regular heap memory or reserved SC::VirtualMemory using only limited amounts of Physical memory.

# Roadmap

ðŸŸ¦ Complete Features:
- Things will be added as needed

ðŸ’¡ Unplanned Features:  

- SharedPtr
- UniquePtr

@note In [Principles](@ref page_principles) there is a rule that discourages allocations of large number of tiny objects and also creating systems with unclear or shared memory ownership.
For this reason this library is missing Smart Pointers.
