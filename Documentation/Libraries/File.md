# Status
ðŸŸ© Usable  
This library has a relatively limited scope and it should not need many additional features compared to now.   
Will consider bumping to Complete in the future.

# Description
SC::FileDescriptor object can be created by SC::FileDescriptor::open-ing a path on file system and it can be SC::FileDescriptor::read or SC::FileDescriptor::write.  
Also non-blocking mode can be controlled with SC::FileDescriptor::setBlocking.  
A file can be marked as inheritable with SC::FileDescriptor::setInheritable so that in can be accessed by child processes. 
SC::PipeDescriptor creates a pipe for InterProcess communication.  
A pipe has read and write SC::FileDescriptor endpoints and it's used by [Process](@ref library_process) library to redirect standard input, output or error to other processes.  
It can also be used to read or write the standard input, output or error from current process into a binary buffer or a string (as done by SC::ProcessChain::readStdOutUntilEOFSync or other similar methods).
