@brief ðŸŸ¨ Concurrently read, write and transform byte streams

[TOC]

[SaneCppAsyncStreams.h](https://github.com/Pagghiu/SaneCppLibraries/releases/latest/download/SaneCppAsyncStreams.h) is a library that reads and writes data concurrently from async sources to destinations.

@note Even if the state machine is not strictly depending on @ref library_async, most practical uses of this library will be using it, so it can be considered an extension of @ref library_async

# Dependencies
- Direct dependencies: [Async](@ref library_async), [Foundation](@ref library_foundation)

# Status
ðŸŸ¨ MVP  

A basic set of stream to pipe Sockets and Files (Pipes included) has been implemented.  
Also basic transform streams (ZLib based) have been implemented.  
It's possible that its API will evolve a little bit to be less verbose and there is also lack of nice examples, aside from the tests.

# Implementation

Async Streams support reading from an async source and placing such reads in a bounded request queue that will pause the stream when it becomes full or when there are no available buffers.
Data is pushed downstream to listeners of data events, that are either transform streams or writers streams.
Writers will eventually emit a `drain` event to signal that they can write more data. 
Such event can be used to resume the readable streams that may have been paused.
AsyncPipeline doesn't use the `drain` event but it just resumes readable streams after every successful write.
This works because the Readable will pause when running out of buffers, allowing them to resume when a new one is made available.

## Memory allocation
Async streams do not allocate any memory, but use caller provided buffers for handling data and request queues.
