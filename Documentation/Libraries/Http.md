# Features
- HTTP 1.1 Parser
- HTTP 1.1 Client
- HTTP 1.1 Server

# Status
ðŸŸ¥ Draft  
In current state the library is able to host simple static website but it cannot be used for any internet facing application.  

# Description
The HTTP parser is an incremental parser, that will emit events as soon as a valid element has been successfully parsed.
This allows handling incomplete responses without needing holding it entirely in memory.

The HTTP client and server are for now just some basic implementations and are missing some important feature.
