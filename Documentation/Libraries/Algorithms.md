@brief ðŸŸ¥ Placeholder library templated where algorithms will be placed

[TOC]

Algorithms is a placeholder where templated algorithms will be added as needed over time.

@note `min` and `max` are in `Compiler.h` as they're widely used everywhere

# Status
ðŸŸ¥ Draft  
We need _MOAR_ algorithms.

# Description

Currently the list of algorithms is very short because it only contains only what's needed by other libraries.
They're probably not enough to deserve their own library but hopefully additional algorithms will be added
in the future and it's better grouping them here rather than keeping them around inside other libraries.

# Roadmap

ðŸŸ¨ MVP Features:
- Unique
- Better Sort (Insertion ?)
- Min / Max Element
- Rotate
- Count / Count If

- Not sure what to list here

ðŸ’¡ Unplanned Features:
